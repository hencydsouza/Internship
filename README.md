# Internship
This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to detect whether a plant has a disease or not based on images of the plant. Plant diseases can have a significant impact on crop yields and overall agricultural productivity. Early detection and treatment of these diseases can help prevent crop losses and ensure food security.
